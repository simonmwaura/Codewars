# # You are required to create a simple calculator that returns the result of addition, subtraction, multiplication or division of two numbers.

# # Your function will accept three arguments:
# # The first and second argument should be numbers.
# # The third argument should represent a sign indicating the operation to perform on these two numbers.

# # You should return the result of applying the given operation to these numbers.
